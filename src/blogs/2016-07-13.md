For years now, I have dreamed of building a hardware MIDI device. I initially got the inspiration after learning that the Rock Band drum set has MIDI capabilities. So, I bought a used one at Goodwill and proceeded to rip it apart. Upon examining the insides of the pads, I was pleasantly surprised that these mysterious devices were nothing more than a piezo sensor glued to a rubber circle. I'd learned about piezos when I was in school for Audio Engineering. My teacher (no, I'm not making this [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biff_Blumfumgagnge) up), Biff U. Blumfumgagnge, came riding into class one day with his MIDI equipped bicycle.

There were piezos all over the thing and he explained how they worked and I've never been the same. At the moment, it was clear that creating a MIDI controller is incredibly simple and absolutely in reach of anyone who dreamt of doing it. Inspired, I took my ripped up Rock Band drum set pads, soldered an input jack to its piezo, and screwed the pad and jack to a block of wood. After assembly, I grabbed my Arduino Uno and came up with a basic sketch for testing purposes (check it out [here](https://github.com/brandonwkipp/raspbeat)). After creating a makeshift box out of some old cardboard and some quick soldering, it was up and running. I hooked everything up and tapped the pad with a drum stick and voila, MIDI. I felt like a wizard. It was very rewarding to combine my love of music with my new love of code. More updates soon.

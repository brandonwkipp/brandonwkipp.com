      <h2>Coffee Experiment</h2>
      <p>October 21st, 2022</p>
      <p>
        Today is the day. After three months without coffee, I'm going to have a small cup. Nothing special, the same
        coffee I
        used to drink daily. Black, no additives.
      </p>
      <p>
        UPDATE: Finished my cup at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoPlkmYaEQs">10:24am</a>. Nice timing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally stopped drinking caffiene on reading a post in the <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/misophonia/">misophonia subreddit</a>. Someone was advocating their experience
        of removing caffiene from their diet and the benefits they felt because
        of it. I'd
        never thought about how caffiene may play a role in my own struggles with misophonia, but seeing that discussion
        made me
        think I should give it a try. What did I have to lose?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I was reluctant to just stop having coffee for the rest of my life, I decided to stop drinking caffiene
        for only
        three months and observe its absence in my day to day. Before the experiment, jitters, anxiety, and agitation
        were
        common occurences and I wasn't sure caffiene was the culprit. For all I knew, it could have simply been noise
        interfering with my well-being. After three months, I can safely say caffiene <em>was</em> a definite, but not
        solely
        responsible, contributor in the creation of those states of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning came withdrawl symptoms; headaches, feeling tired, and difficulty focusing really made that
        first week difficult. After that though, things improved with a noticeable reduction in my anxiety and agitation
        levels
        (no jitters either). Things started to feel a little off without the morning ritual
        associated with coffee. After the week of withdrawl, the days felt more like perfect sine waves,
        predictable and kind
        of unexpressive. When drinking coffee, days had more creative shapes to their cycles and felt more
        serendipitous.
        Coffee obviously modulates the way our brains form thoughts, but I hadn't really realized I'd
        been using coffee to do more than just wake up in the morning. I've missed the slightly chaotic aspects
        of
        how it alters the signals being synthesized in my brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the small cup I've drank since writing this, I feel more awake and more contemplative. I always notice the
        apex of
        this effect when my eyes feel wide open. The skin around my eyes always feels smoother and my vision is slightly
        sharper. Its hard to explain but it feels like the subconcious parts of my brain start spinning and change the
        shape of
        my thoughts for the rest of the day. Its like somebody turned on a bunch of features in the software
        powering my reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        My takeway from this experiment is this: coffee has benefits and drawbacks and I should be more observant and
        proactive
        in how I approach drinking coffee. Moderation, like so many other things in life, is key. Cutting
        caffiene correlated with a substantial reduction in negative emotions day to day. I
        don't know
        that I was necessarily as productive in a measured output, but I don't think I was using it as a crutch for
        quality, but
        maybe for quantity. Try it yourself. If you know how to reach me, let me know what you think.

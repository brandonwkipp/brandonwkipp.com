      <h2>Colors</h2>
      <p>June 19th, 2016</p>

        Today, I'm updating the color scheme on my website. I've never really researched color theory before today, but
        there is quite a bit of information out there. I read a few blogs and was vaguely reminded of my high school art
        class, but I didn't really pay attention back then. Anyway, I found this rad <a href="https://color.adobe.com"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tool</a> where you can pick color templates based on dividing the
        color wheel in attractive ways. The old color scheme I was using was terrible, but to be fair, I had no idea how
        to pick good colors. It has got me thinking about the way things are packaged, and how satisfying a simple color
        scheme is. I'm sure I'm more likely to buy a product if its color scheme is pleasing to me.

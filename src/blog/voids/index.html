        I don't think I have genuinely let myself feel emotions for a long time. Just sitting and...<i>feeling</i>
        Understanding the context, understanding the way in which my memories and synapses fire, in unison, in real
        time, to create what I'm...feeling. The other day I hear the saying, "Suffering is not a necessary part of life,
        but contrast is" and that made quite a bit of sense to me. I don't have to suffer, or wallow, or sink into those
        kinds of energy states. After all, I'm a pretty lucky dude with a decent lot in life; things could be way worse
        than they are for me, and I'm thankful that they aren't. But in these moments, it's hard to remember that fact;
        it is difficult to cling to gratitude when I feel low. It's tempting to get through it by working harder and
        completely rejecting the feelings that course through me. It is ok to feel.

      <h2>Tomato Plant</h2>
      <p>June 28th, 2016</p>
      <p>
        Today, my partner brought home a Cherry Tomato plant from a local church. It's pretty small, but it's growing so
        fast I swear I can see it move. I've got this UV grow light that only emits the relevant wavelengths for
        photosynthesis. It's sort of pink, and reminiscent of a nightclubâ€”much different from the cheery yellow that we
        normally experience. It's easy to take plants for granted, but we have a lot to learn from them. <a
          href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/10/e1501136" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An
          article</a> that came out a while back discusses roses that were made to hold electrical circuits. What does
        that mean for the future? Maybe if trees were able to transmit WiFi, we would stop cutting them down.

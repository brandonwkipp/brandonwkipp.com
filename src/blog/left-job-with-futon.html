      <h2>Why did I leave my job that came with a futon?</h2>

        Strap in, this rollercoaster is about to start. I <i><u>really</u></i> liked the job that came with a futon, and
        not just for the futon perk. If you don't know, I make my living writing and solving people's problems through
        software. In the job with the futon, I was constantly bombarded with interesting projects and problems to solve.
        I spent a lot of cycles building programs for Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's where, with the help of some great
        folks in the machine shop, we'd transform those little boards into fully-fledged interactive exhibits. We wired
        up sensors to communicate with JavaScript applications and helped educate people. When I wasn't on those
        projects, I worked on the website where I touched basically every part. Testing, scripting, database stuff,
        serverless functions and so much more. And I loved doing that stuff. I liked how introverted and productive I
        could be, both aligning with my true personality. And did I mention it came with a futon? (I found futons helped

      <h2>Organization</h2>
      <p>June 8th, 2016</p>
      <p>
        Everything is in its place, and every place has its thing. The last thing I want to do is to spend my entire
        life organizing my life. How much organization is really necessary? Enough to put your mind at ease. These walls
        aren't your home. No walls could ever enclose what you call home. Life knows no bounds. It cannot be contained.
        It must be strange to be an architect. They design with strength and permanence in mind, but a building is no
        more permanent than a painting. A popular painting, even when lost a millennium ago, survives in replicas. Even
        our strongest structures would collapse in a few hundred years without human care. You can make prints of
        paintings. You can make replicas of buildings, but the experience cannot be replicated. Artists experience art
        as they create it. What we see is one infinitely long degree away from true art. When you organize that dirty
        plate, that moldy pizza at the back of the fridge, and that old receipt, you are arranging a gallery.

        My workplace sometimes has these "treasure trove" days where employees can bring in objects they no longer want
        and give them away in a kind of anonymous swap meet. In the past, what you might describe as "junk" had a way of
        finding its way into my lap. That is to say, when these kinds of situations have presented themselves, I often
        end up with too much, thinking I can find the time and resources to repair or use various electronics. That
        said, I have been implementing a more minimalist lifestyle lately, but I still wanted to remain vigilant.

        Thankfully, there wasn't much to piqued my interest, except for a literal bucket of <a
          href="https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=Casio%20SK-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Casio
          SK-1</a> sampling keyboards. It was too good to not pass up, seeing as I don't own a hardware sampler. I took
        two, in case on breaks, and I'm glad I did. It is really a treat to play and goes well with my other smaller
        keyboards. Score.

      <h2>Blood Pressure No. 1</h2>

        Well, that's not great; although, not surprising since I'm a relatively sedentary person. I'm pretty stressed
        these days with the amount of things on my plate. My body is pretty clearly telling me to walk more. The
        exercise have been doing seems to be too much; now that I'm not at the gym anymore, there's nothing from
        stopping me from working too hard. For a while, I was doing rucking with around 20 lbs. in a backpack on my
        back. After doing that daily for about month straight, my back started hurting. I thought about dropping some of
        the weight, but I just stopped doing it out of fear of hurting myself more. More recently I've been doing a lot
        of arm lifting and I think even that hurt me. I think it caused some pretty excruciating back/shoulder pain I've
        been dealing with for the last week or so. All that seems left is to just walk. Or not go so hard.

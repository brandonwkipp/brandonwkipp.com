        For years now, I have dreamed of building a hardware MIDI device. I initially got the inspiration after learning
        that the Rock Band drum set has MIDI capabilities. So, I bought a used one at Goodwill and proceeded to rip it
        apart. Upon examining the insides of the pads, I was pleasantly surprised these mysterious devices were nothing
        more than a piezo sensor glued to a rubber circle. I'd learned about piezos at school when my teacher, <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biff_Blumfumgagnge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Biff</a>,
        came riding into class one day on a bicycle he transformed into a MIDI controller by covering it in piezos and
        DIN plugs. The lightbulb went off in my brain as it became clear creating a MIDI controller is relatively
        simple. Inspired, I took my ripped up Rock Band drum set pads, soldered an input jack to its piezo, and screwed
        the pad and jack to a block of wood. After assembly, I grabbed an Arduino Uno and wrote <a
          href="https://github.com/brandonwkipp/raspbeat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a simple sketch to
          transform an analog input into a MIDI message</a>. After creating a makeshift box out of some old cardboard
        and some quick soldering, it was up and running. I hooked everything up and tapped the pad with a drum stick and
        voila, MIDI. I felt like a wizard. It was very rewarding to combine my love of music with my new love of code.

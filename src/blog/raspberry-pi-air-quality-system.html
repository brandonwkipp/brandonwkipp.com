      <h2>Raspberry Pi Air Quality System</h2>
      <p>January 3rd, 2022</p>
      <p>
        For a few years now, I've been working with my Dad to build an air quality monitoring system for his house. The
        goal is to measure the temperature and humidity in multiple rooms around the house to help him know which
        dampers should be opened or closed to better control the environment.

      <p>
        We've iterated on the idea of this system for a few years and we've finally come up with a good prototype to
        deploy. Thankfully, Dad has already run a bunch of 4-conductor wire throughout the house in anticipation for a
        project such as this. We're gonna to use it to wire up a bunch of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/385"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DHT-22</a> sensors to a central Raspberry Pi in the basement.

        After doing some research on databases for projects like this, I came across the <a
          href="https://www.influxdata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">InfluxDB time series
          database</a>. During the initial prototyping phase, I ran into a big roadblock; the default Raspbian OS
        doesn't support InfluxDB v2, with the included GUI, because it is a 32-bit operating system. This took me by
        surprise as I had thought Raspbian had always been 64-bit. I briefly tried to work with an older version of
        InfluxDB that runs on 32-bit systems, and it worked well enough but I really wanted the frontend user interface.
        I tried installing <a href="https://grafana.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grafana</a> to act
        as the frontend but ran into the same 32-bit vs 64-bit issue and decided the trouble of maintaining a 32-bit
        system was not worth it. Next, I tried using Raspbian's 64-bit beta version but still couldn't get it working so
        finally, I ditched Raspbian for Ubuntu Server.
      </p>

        While Ubuntu is Ubuntu, I hadn't ever used Ubuntu Server and immediately ran into an issue connecting to wifi.
        After some brief googling, I learned <a href="https://netplan.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          how <code>netplan</code> works</a> (which is apparently what Ubuntu Server uses for wifi) and was able to
        successfully configure the <code>wlan0</code> interface to connect pretty easily. From there, everything was
        smooth sailing; InfluxDB installed fine and worked out of the box. Now, all that's left is to connect the
        sensors and finish the <code>cron</code> script for reading values from each sensor. More to come.

I don't exactly remember the day or month of this show, so I made it up. I think this is the first show I ever played, in fact, it wasn't even pre-meditated; my friend Holly coaxed me to get up play a few songs when they had an opening. I remember  covering "Dumb" by Nirvana, and "Bound to pack it up" by the White Stripes on acoustic guitar, but I don't remember anything else.

I don't exactly remember the day or month of this show, so I picked an approximate date. If my memory serves right, this is the first show I ever played, and it wasn't even planned! I was attending an open mic, and a friend of mine coaxed me to sign up and play a few songs. I only remember covering "Dumb" by Nirvana, and "Bound to pack it up" by the White Stripes on acoustic guitar.

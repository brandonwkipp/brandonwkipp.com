Work occasionally has these "treasure trove" days where we, as an organization, decide to offer up perfectly good stuff that we don't use anymore, to any member of our staff to take home with them. A co-worker and I found a literal bucket full of Casio SK-1 sampling keyboards. We each took one. I'll post some videos of it in action at a later date. It felt good to go to one of these things and get motivated to haul "junk" that I actually wanted for once. Instead of just finding something that piqued my interest but I don't actually want. Being intentional feels good.

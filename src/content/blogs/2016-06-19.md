Today, I'm updating the color scheme on my website. I've never really researched color theory before today, but there is quite a bit of information out there. I read a few blogs and was vaguely reminded of my high school art class, but I didn't really pay attention back then. Anyway, I found this rad [tool](https://color.adobe.com) where you can pick color templates based on dividing the color wheel in attractive ways. The old color scheme I was using was terrible, but to be fair, I had no idea how to pick good colors. It has got me thinking about the way things are packaged, and how satisfying a simple color scheme is. I'm sure I'm more likely to buy a product if its color scheme is pleasing to me.

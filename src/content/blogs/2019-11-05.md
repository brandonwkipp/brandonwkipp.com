I don't think I have genuinely let myself feel emotions for a long time. Just sitting and...feeling. Understanding the context, understanding the way in which my memories and synapses fire, in unison, in real time, to create what I'm...**feeling**. The other day I hear the saying, "Suffering is not a necessary part of life, but contrast is" and that made quite a bit of sense to me. I don't have to suffer, or wallow, or sink into those kinds of energy states. After all, I'm a pretty lucky dude with a decent lot in life; things could be way worse than they are for me, and I'm thankful that they aren't. But in these moments, it's hard to remember that fact; it is difficult to cling to gratitude when I feel low. It's tempting to get through it by working harder and completely rejecting the feelings that course through me. It is ok to feel.

It is ok to be ok.

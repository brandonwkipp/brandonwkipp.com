I cannot believe how long I have lived with this sense that I am somehow unique in the way I organize my reality. Many hours have been spent on foolish quests to make something turn out in a particular manner; a Raspberry Pi file server with automated backup scripts, a phone littered with the latest apps to customize how it operates, patch cables made with the highest quality materials, soldered by my own hand and inspected with my own eyes. Now I know the truth, life is only as hard as you make it. Quests are flying at us non-stop and it's tempting to believe it's my narrative, but it always feels like someone else intended for me to take up the mantle.

It is simpler to sit down, shut up, and really listen to the voice inside your head that you connects with you. For me, it takes a while to sink in and know that I am listening to the correct voice amongst the incessant chatter my AI ego spouts. Sifting through that asteroid field is an easy way for me to find peace in the moment, a way to understand what is important. Simplicity keeps popping out at me, I would say daily at this point. 

Throw that useless thing out. Cancel that unneeded service. Do the plain work.

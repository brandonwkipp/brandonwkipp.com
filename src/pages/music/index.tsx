                I had a blast at this show. As we played, I stepped on my fuzz box and broke a lead on the battery connector. No monitors, very hard to hear what I was playing, but people tell me we sounded good.

                This was our first show as a band. I think by this point, we were a couple months old. Shout to Darious for hooking us up with a spot.

                I went to an open mic with some friends. Next thing I know, someone coaxed me to sign up and play a few songs. I only remember covering "Dumb" by Nirvana, and "Bound to pack it up" by the White Stripes on acoustic.

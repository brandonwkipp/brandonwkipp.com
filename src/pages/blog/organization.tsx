    <p>
      Everything is in its place, and every place has its thing. The last thing I
      want to do is to spend my entire life organizing my life. How much organization
      is really necessary? Enough to put your mind at ease. These walls aren't your
      home. No walls could ever enclose what you call home. Life knows no bounds. It
      cannot be contained. It must be strange to be an architect. They design with
      strength and permanence in mind, but a building is no more permanent than a
      painting. A popular painting, even when lost a millennium ago, survives in
      replicas. Even our strongest structures would collapse in a few hundred years
      without human care. You can make prints of paintings. You can make replicas of
      buildings, but the experience cannot be replicated. Artists experience art as
      they create it. What we see is one infinitely long degree away from true art.
      When you organize that dirty plate, that moldy pizza at the back of the fridge,
      and that old receipt, you are arranging a gallery.

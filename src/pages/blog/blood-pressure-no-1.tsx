      Well, that's not great; although, not surprising since I'm a relatively sedentary person.
      I'm pretty stressed these days with the amount of things on my plate. My body is pretty
      clearly telling me to walk more. The exercise have been doing seems to be too much; now
      that I'm not at the gym anymore, there's nothing from stopping me from working too hard.
      For a while, I was doing rucking with around 20 lbs. in a backpack on my back. After doing
      that daily for about month straight, my back started hurting. I thought about dropping some
      of the weight, but I just stopped doing it out of fear of hurting myself more. More recently
      I've been doing a lot of arm lifting and I think even that hurt me. I think it caused some
      pretty excruciating back/shoulder pain I've been dealing with for the last week or so. All
      that seems left is to just walk. Or not go so hard.

      I'm sure literally everyone feels like the rug has been pulled out from under them right now, I know I do. The future was seeming good; I had just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250239087/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_S5zDEbZVYKGJQ">Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now</a> by Jaron Lanier, and was taking a suggested break from social for a moment to re-evaluate my relationship to it and assess my direction. I noticed chunks of time opening up where I would have been checking social, and was retraining myself to do something more productive in those spaces. And then, all at once, Covid-19.

      I slowly abandoned my new found freedom in favor of being up to date and immediately started noticing that I was calmly freaking out; I still don't know if that's because of social or Covid-19, but I'm guessing the latter. Thoughts of barren shelves and bank runs started grasping my attention, as well as the looming deadlines to renew my Driver's License and do my taxes. I just got a new pair of glasses so that I could pass my vision test. I was moving forward, and now I don't feel like I am. But I'm betting I'm not alone. I sure hope I'm not.

      I'm sure everyone wants everything to go back to normal, but it's seeming like that will not be the case. We were overdue for a recession, yada yada. I already miss the routine that I took for granted. I'm sure we'll all get through this, but this sucks.

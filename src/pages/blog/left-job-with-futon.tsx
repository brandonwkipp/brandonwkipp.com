      Strap in, this rollercoaster is about to start. I <i><u>really</u></i> liked the job that came with a futon, and not just for the futon perk. If you don't know, I make my living writing and solving people's problems through software. In the job with the futon, I was constantly bombarded with interesting projects and problems to solve. I spent a lot of cycles building programs for Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's where, with the help of some great folks in the machine shop, we'd transform those little boards into fully-fledged interactive exhibits. We wired up sensors to communicate with JavaScript applications and helped educate people. When I wasn't on those projects, I worked on the website where I touched basically every part. Testing, scripting, database stuff, serverless functions and so much more. And I loved doing that stuff. I liked how introverted and productive I could be, both aligning with my true personality. And did I mention it came with a futon? (I found futons helped with my ergonomics because I could change the angles and positions of my limbs far easier with one).
